The data was cleaned using the `pandas` and `PILLOW` libraries. The csv file was read into a variable called `df` using the `pd.read_csv()` function. The prices column contains non-numerical values which need to be cleaned and to do this the `.replace()` function was applied to the column replacing the Â£ symbol with nothing.

The image dataset also needed to be cleaned to be used for analysis using the `PILLOW` library. The images are set a size of 512px x 512px and rescaled to the new size.
